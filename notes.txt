** Font

It seems that "gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name" might not work on Cinnamon or MATE.

So the logic should be redesigned so that

1) We check that gsettings exists (for example by calling the "which gsettings" process)
*) Meta: In a VM we check if the gnome key is good for all DEs mentioned, if not, then...
2) We determine the current Gnome-based DE if we can and try all schemas
3) If we are in KDE or XFCE and this fails, we go to fallback

Also probably we should not be listening for font changes, this feels a bit too unstable
